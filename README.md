This is an Android clone of Secret that is mainly a proof of concept that I built for fun and learning.

* Completely powered by Parse (feed, profiles, friendships, etc)
* Login is via Facebook
* Secrets are shared to Facebook friends AND people in your networks (schools, work, city)

This app is still pretty rough, but is fully working in its current state. I have no current plans to release it, but it could probably be released with only a few days of love and attention.
